1.1- <color=#4A6AFF>Great White Sharks</color>, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones. The first two rows of the teeth are used for <color=#EA0000>grabbing and cutting</color> the animals they <color=#FF00CA>eat</color>, while the other teeth in the last rows replace the front teeth when they are <color=#B7984A>broken</color>, worn down, or when they fall out. The teeth have the shape of a triangle with <color=#FF6800>jags</color> on the edges. Great White Sharks <color=#FF00CA>eat</color> fish and other animals, for example <color=#00FF53>seals and sea lions.</color>

1.2- <color=#FF6800>The Great White Shark</color> has no natural predators other than the <color=#000000>Orca</color>. Some orcas have discovered they can <color=#FFE600>paralyse</color> the shark by flipping it upside-down. Then they hold the shark still with their mouth, and that <color=#EA0000>suffocates</color> it, since sharks get <color=#02FEFF>oxygen</color> by moving through the water. That aside, they are <color=#EA0000>apex predators</color> of marine mammals.

2.1- <color=#FF6800>The Great White Shark</color> is the world's largest known <color=#FF00CA>predatory fish</color>, meaning it <color=#FFE600>hunts</color> for its food. It is <color=#EA0000>powerful and aggressive</color>. It is at the top of the ocean's food chain. <color=#000000>Orca whales</color> or other <color=#FF6800>Great White Sharks</color> themselves are the only <color=#EA0000>predator</color> of the <color=#FF6800>Great White Shark</color>.

2.2- <color=#FF6800>Sharks</color> count on the element of <color=#EA0000>surprise</color> as they hunt. When they see a <color=#4A6AFF>seal</color> at the water, sharks will often position themselves <color=#B7984A><b>underneath</b></color> the seal. Using their <color=#02FEFF>tails as propellers</color>, they swim <color=#02FEFF>upward</color> at a fast sprint, burst out of the water in a leap called a <color=#FF00CA>breach</color>, and fall back into the water with the seal in their <color=#EA0000>mouth.</color>

3- At <color=#FFE600>birth</color> a baby Great White Shark is about <color=#02FEFF>five feet</color> long. When a Great White Shark is born, along with up to <color=#B7984A>twelve</color> siblings, it immediately swims <color=#FF9400>away</color> from its mother. It lives on its own <color=#000000>immediately.</color> A mother may see her newborn sharks as <color=#EA0000>prey.</color>

4.1- Most people <color=#EA0000>fear</color> the Great White Shark and consider it a <color=#FF9400>man-eater</color>, but shark attacks usually happen because sharks <color=#00FF53>confuse</color> humans with seals. A Great White gives a <color=#FF00CA>"test-bite"</color>, but it is unlikely that it keeps eating once it finds <color=#FFE600>unusual food</color>.

4.2- Great White Sharks live and hunt on the coast of <color=#00FF53>every continent</color> in the world <color=#00FF53>except Antarctica</color>. They prefer to live in <color=#02FEFF>cooler waters</color> with temps ranging from <color=#4A6AFF>54-75 degrees</color>.

5- Great White Sharks are <color=#FFE600>decreasing</color> in numbers and are <color=#FF9400>rare</color> due to years of being <color=#EA0000>hunted</color> by man for fins and teeth. They are also seen as a <color=#B7984A>trophy</color> for sport fishing. Great Whites are often <color=#EA0000>caught</color> in nets or entangled in mesh that protects the beach.

FACTS:
1- Great White Sharks can be found <color=#FF2D2D>throughout the world's oceans,</color> mostly in <color=#FF2D2D>cool waters</color> close to the coast.

2- They are the <color=#FF2D2D>largest predatory fish</color> on our planet, on average they grow up to <color=#FF2D2D>4.6m (15 feet)</color> long, sometimes <color=#FF2D2D>6m (19.6 feet),</color> that's almost half the length of a bus!

3- Great White Sharks are <color=#FF2D2D>grey with a white underbelly.</color> They have a streamlined shape and powerful tails that propel them through the water at over <color=#FF2D2D>60km per hour!</color>

4- Their mouth is equipped with a set of <color=#FF2D2D>300 sharp, triangular teeth</color> arranged in up to <color=#FF2D2D>seven rows,</color> yikes!

5- They are <color=#FF2D2D>not</color> fearsome man-eaters, <color=#FF2D2D>phew!</color> There are around <color=#FF2D2D>5-10 attacks per year,</color> but researchers think that sharks are instead taking a <color=#FF2D2D>"sample bite"</color> out of curiosity, before swimming off.

6- <color=#FF2D2D>Young</color> white sharks feed on small prey, such as <color=#FF2D2D>fish and rays.</color> But when they're <color=#FF2D2D>older and bigger,</color> they generally feast on sea mammals such as <color=#FF2D2D>sea lions, seals and small whales.</color>

7-They have a <color=#FF2D2D>strong sense of smell</color> that they can detect a colony of seals two miles away. And check this out - if there was only one drop of blood in 100 litres of water, a great white would smell it!

8-They like to <color=#FF2D2D>take their prey by surprise.</color> They usually position themselves underneath their unsuspecting victims before swimming up and... CHOMP! They often burst out of the water in a leap (called a breach) before falling back in with their meal in their mouths.

9-When a Great White gives <color=#FF2D2D>birth,</color> she usually has <color=#FF2D2D>two to ten youngsters, called "pups".</color> But she shows no care for her offspring - in fact, she may even <color=#FF2D2D>try to eat them!</color> Taking care of themselves, the newborn pups will immediately swim off into the ocean.

10-They are at the <color=#FF2D2D>top of the food chain</color> and aren't likely to be killed by other sea creatures. Sadly, however, they are under serious threat by human activity. Illegal hunting of these beautiful beasts, and over-hunting, have meant that today they are an <color=#FF2D2D>endangered species.</color>
