-Great White Sharks!

1.1- Great White Sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones. The first two rows of the teeth are used for grabbing and cutting the animals they eat, while the other teeth in the last rows replace the front teeth when they are broken, worn down, or when they fall out. The teeth have the shape of a triangle with jags on the edges. Great White Sharks eat fish and other animals, for example seals and sea lions.

1.2- The great white shark has no natural predators other than the Orca. Some orcas have discovered they can paralyse the shark by flipping it upside-down. Then they hold the shark still with their mouth, and that suffocates it, since sharks get oxygen by moving through the water. That aside, they are apex predators of marine mammals.

2.1- The Great White Shark is the world's largest known predatory fish, meaning it hunts for its food. It is powerful and aggressive. It is at the top of the ocean's food chain. Orca whales or other Great White Sharks themselves are the only predator of the Great White Shark.

2.2- Sharks count on the element of surprise as they hunt. When they see a seal at the water, sharks will often position themselves underneath the seal. Using their tails as propellers, they swim upward at a fast sprint, burst out of the water in a leap called a breach, and fall back into the water with the seal in their mouth.

3-At birth a baby Great White Shark is about five feet long. When a Great White Shark is born, along with up to twelve siblings, it immediately swims away from its mother. It lives on its own immediately. A mother may see her newborn sharks as prey.

4.1- Most people fear the Great White Shark and consider it a man-eater, but shark attacks usually happen because sharks confuse humans with seals. A Great White gives a "test-bite," but it is unlikely that it keeps eating once it finds unusual food.

4.2- Great White Sharks live and hunt on the coast of every continent in the world except Antarctica. They prefer to live in cooler waters with temps ranging from 54-75 degrees.

5- Great White Sharks are decreasing in numbers and are rare due to years of being hunted by man for fins and teeth. They are also seen as a trophy for sport fishing. Great Whites are often caught in nets or entangled in mesh that protects the beach.
